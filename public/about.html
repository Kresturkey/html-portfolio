<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>There is a lot I can say about myself but it doesn't feel like something I need to do at this moment but I believe
  that with time, everything will unfold accordingly and more will be made known.</p>

<p>At some point you just want to see how much of a better version of yourslef you can become even against so many odds
  considering where you come from and how far you wish to get.
  I am not really trying to make sense but to occupy this space with meaningful words that makes up a passage that does
  really say anything.
